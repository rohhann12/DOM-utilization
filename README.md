# DOM-utilization---1

Used DOM Maninupilation and made a clone of how requests go out on social media platforms (basically learned how to use document.querySelector and addEventListener)

like initially

and when I click the add friend button it goes to the person the request is being sent and depending upon the response changes are made( I havent implemented those though)


though same button is used for removing or adding the friend
